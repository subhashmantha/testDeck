## Overview

1. Developed an application using R and Shiny Server

2. The application performs simple summarization, display and regression analysis

3. The user does not have to write code either to read files, summarize data, or run regressions

4. The outputs are visible immediately and the user can make new selections of variales

---

## Inputs

1. Application takes in a csv file as input

2. The file may or may not contain a header. It is preferable to have a header line

3. populates two lists - one for selecting depndent vars and the other for selecting independent vars
```{r}
in.1<-mtcars
model<-lm(mpg~wt+am,data=in.1)

```

## Ouputs
===========================================================
1. Based on selection of radio buttons three outputs can be generated

2. When regression is selected a regression summary and plot of residuals is generated
```{r}
summary (model)
```

## Slide 5
Sample Output
============================================================
```{r}
plot(resid(model),in.1$mpg,ylab="residual",xlab="mpg")
```
